# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 3: January 1, 2016
***Todays Progress***:
-Started Working on freecodecamp.com Java script lessons. after i pushed my started portfolio over to codepen.io
-been sitting and taking notes as i learn JavaScript
-adjusted the text in my IDE to match what the format is in codepen.io
-changed the pictures to the links online instead of local pictures i saved

***Thoughts***:
Like i have stated before i decided to finally just upload my portfolio to codepen.io and move on to Java script because i know now that i am going to be hoping in and out of my portfolio and building it up. I plan to adjust the sections tomorrow and add a type of section for Github. Maybe incorporate my Twitter account again so my "100DaysOfCode" can reflect on my portfolio as an ongoing "project" or event i am doing.

### Day 2: January 2, 2016
***Todays Progress***:
-changed the page to only show my Initials. Like the minimal vibe.
-added a nice space background
-changed the "About Me" section with a new description

***Thoughts***:
I do want this page to take a more minimal vibe to it. Not being overburden by contrasting colors and borders on top of borders on top of images.
The Section that i edited in the about me section was something i just decided to do because i really think that trying to show your true nature is a definitely a lot more interesting than a general "hello, i am rob, i am 21, i have a dog...blah blah blah"

### Day 1: January 1, 2016
***Todays Progress***:
-Changed the associated social media accounts i had linked on my portfolio
-Decided on a different background image(took a while to decided, though i will probably be adjusting the background as time moves on)
-Moved my page sections way down.

***Thoughts***:
Even though this is a project for freecodecamp.com , i am going to continue to adjust and improve this as time goes on. I am not the most creative personal so when it came time for me to put my portfolio together I was drawing blanks originally on how i wanted the page to look.
