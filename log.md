# 100 Days Of Code - Log
### Day 001: January 8, 2016
***Todays Progress***:
- Reinstalled Windows and am now off of ubuntu. (Took literally an entire day...crap interwebs)
- Configured GitKraken + Visual Studio Code + Github to talk to each other. Thankfully visual studio code had some great walkthroughs. and i undertsnad how to cone repos into local folders. 
- Installed Git to windows to run my JavaScript practice programs. (which to me some time to figure out i HAD to do to debug JavaScript)
- Created a new repository for my new jav practice. PLan to starta JavaScript Project

***Thoughts***:
- these past few days with switching to back to windows have been a slight nightmare but a nice lesson of IDE and what node is etc. I had no real clue on how set up an IDE. Glad i acually took the time for this setup to read, and watch some tutorials for the IDE. So i do not get stuck and get all fustrated with trying to run my small practice programs

### January 7, 2016
***Todays Progress***:
- Complete 16 classes on freecodecamp.
- took some good notes while i was doing the classes 
***Thoughts***:
- java script is really going to send me througha  loop. i Actually got stuck for a good 10 minuites just tyring to figure out how it wasnted me to write "I am a dog". Utilizing a function with a set of parametrs. IE function wordBlank(adVerb, Adjective, Noun)etc.

### Day XX: January X, 2016
***Todays Progress***:
- Completed 11 items on freecodecamp.com
- deciede to do classes insteadof work on project. didnt have much time

***Thoughts***:
- looks like i am goign to have to reset this "100 Days Of Code" timer. I am not to worried about it thought I liek to think that the point it to develop yourself as a programmer by building that good habit of programming eveyrday. So as long as you understand the "evnt" is about you and your development, the rest is just something to put a face on it.

### January 1, 2016
***Todays Progress***:
- Started Working on freecodecamp.com Java script lessons. after i pushed my started portfolio over to codepen.io
- been sitting and taking notes as i learn JavaScript
- adjusted the text in my IDE to match what the format is in codepen.io
- changed the pictures to the links online instead of local pictures i saved

***Thoughts***:
- Like i have stated before i decided to finally just upload my portfolio to codepen.io and move on to Java script because i know now that i am going to be hoping in and out of my portfolio and building it up. I plan to adjust the sections tomorrow and add a type of section for Github. Maybe incorporate my Twitter account again so my "100DaysOfCode" can reflect on my portfolio as an ongoing "project" or event i am doing.

### January 2, 2016
***Todays Progress***:
- changed the page to only show my Initials. Like the minimal vibe.
- added a nice space background
- changed the "About Me" section with a new description

***Thoughts***:
- I do want this page to take a more minimal vibe to it. Not being overburden by contrasting colors and borders on top of borders on top of images.
- The Section that i edited in the about me section was something i just decided to do because i really think that trying to show your true nature is a definitely a lot more interesting than a general "hello, i am rob, i am 21, i have a dog...blah blah blah"

### January 1, 2016
***Todays Progress***:
- Changed the associated social media accounts i had linked on my portfolio
- Decided on a different background image(took a while to decided, though i will probably be adjusting the background as time moves on)
- Moved my page sections way down.

***Thoughts***:
- Even though this is a project for freecodecamp.com , i am going to continue to adjust and improve this as time goes on. I am not the most creative personal so when it came time for me to put my portfolio together I was drawing blanks originally on how i wanted the page to look.
